We're happy to announce a half-day workshop at the 2020 [Joint Conference on Digital Libraries](https://2020.jcdl.org/). 

The workshop will take place online **August 1st** - When registration opens information can be found [here](https://2020.jcdl.org/Registration.html). 

Note: We are still waiting on details of exactly how the workshop will be run remotely. If you have any questions please be in touch with `nmweber@uw.edu `. We plan to treat this as an opportunity to Workshop papers that are in progress - please consider submitting any working ideas, position papers, or compeleted research that you would like feedback on.  

### Call For Papers

**Workshop Description**        
Conceptual models have long been fundamental to the development of information systems and the delivery of information services. As digital libraries, archives, museums, and other information organizations evolve to meet new information needs, there is simultaneously a need to revisit the assumptions upon which these technologies were originally designed. This includes the various ways that information objects are conceived of, described, and made discoverable by users of an information system -  as well as the relationship between complex digital objects as they are linked and shared across the web. 

Conceptual modeling, understood to include concerns of both logical as well as physical models, is fundamental to delivering useful information experiences to end-users --  but their design, implementation, and maintenance often goes under-addressed in the Information Science literature. We seek to fill this gap through an annual workshop series -- SIG-CM -- that focuses on emerging research themes for modeling information, collections, and sociotechnical systems. 

**Contributions**       
The 2020 SIG-CM at JCDL seeks contributions from a variety of research and practitioner perspectives. This may include, but is not limited to, the following topics: 

- The evolution of conceptual models that govern retrieval, discovery, or access of digital objects in digital library set-tings
- Semantic and other Web standards that instantiate conceptual models
- Empirical techniques and methods for studying conceptual models
- Educational needs in the field of knowledge organization and representation

Contributions may be of two varieties:
- **Full research papers** should present results from completed research, or mature conceptual analysis. Full research papers should be a maximum of 3000 words in length (not including citations).
- **Short research papers** can present in-progress work, small case studies, position statements, or theoretical and conceptual analysis that is at an early stage of development. Short research papers should be a maximum 1500 words in length (not including citations).

**Dates**          
- Submission Deadline is June 28th. 
- Notifications will be sent no later than July 7th 
- Accepted submissions can be revised before August 1st. At the time we will post all accepted submissions to the workshop website.

**Instructions for Submission**            
Please submit a PDF, DOC, Markdown, or TXT document to `nmweber@uw.edu` by June 28th. You may use any format or citation style that you prefer - However, we do suggest following the conference's [ACM template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).  

All Submissions will be reviewed by the organizing committee, and feedback (regardless of acceptance) will be provided to authors. If you have any questions please feel to contact an organizer in advance of the deadline for submissions.
