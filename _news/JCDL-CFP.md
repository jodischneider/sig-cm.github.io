SIG-CM (SIG-Conceptual Modeling) is hosting a workshop at the 2019 [Joint Conference on Digital Libraries](https://2019.jcdl.org/). The workshop will take place on **June 6th** at the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana. 

Consider the call for papers below for directions on submitting to the workshop. 

All accepted submissions will be given a 15-25 minute slot for presentation and discussion. Registration information can be found [here](https://2019.jcdl.org/registration/).


**NOTICE**: The deadline for submissions (as well as early-bird registration for JCDL!) has been extended to **May 10**.

### Call For Papers

**Workshop Description**        
Libraries, archives, museums, and data repositories often rely upon conceptual models that provide formal representation information and identity conditions for digital resources. Examples include conceptual models traditional to library and information science, such as Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR), data models from the semantic web, like the Resource Description Framework (RDF), as well as the development of protocols unique to the exchange of digital objects, such as the Open Archives Initiative for Object Reuse and Exchange (OAI-ORE).

We believe that sustaining a rich tradition of research and development in conceptual modeling requires renewed efforts from the digital library community. Many of the protocols, data models, and descriptive frameworks described above are in need of update, revision and extension to remain useful to the development of new information infrastructures. We therefore seek to convene a group of researchers and practitioners interested in developing a collaborative research agenda around conceptual modeling. 

**Contributions**       
We seek contributions from practitioners and researchers interested in digital collections in many domains, especially collections from different epistemologies and traditions of knowledge organization: natural history museums, art museums, library special collections, archives, data repositories, earth science informatics, biodiversity informatics, etc. This may include topics relevant to conceptual modeling, including but not limited to:  
- the history and evolution of conceptual models,
- extensions to, or critiques of, existing conceptual models,
- the development of domain-specific conceptual models (e.g. in the earth sciences, in the humanities, etc) applied strategies for modeling in development processes,
- critical examination of the social and technical implications of conceptual models.

Contributions may be of two varieties:

- **Full research papers** should present results from completed research, or fully developed conceptual analysis. Full research papers should be a maximum of 3000 words in length (not including citations).
- **Short research papers** can present in-progress work, small case studies, position statements, or theoretical and conceptual analysis that is at an early stage of development. Short research papers should be a maximum 1500 words in length (not including citations).

**Dates**          
- Submission Deadline is ~~April 25th~~ May 10th.
- Notifications will be sent no later than May 12th
- Accepted submissions can be revised before May 25th. At the time we will post all accepted submissions to the workshop website.
- Workshop will take place June 6th.

**Instructions for Submission**            
Please submit a PDF, DOC, or TXT document to `nmweber@uw.edu` by ~~April 25th~~ May 10th. You may use any format or citation style that you prefer - However, we do suggest following the conference's [ACM template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).  

All Submissions will be reviewed by the organizing committee.

We're also excited to announce that [Dr. Karen Wickett](https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/karen-wickett) will be giving a keynote lecture at the workshop! We plan to organize a special issue for an information science journal based on the proceedings. If you have any questions please feel free to get in contact with any of the organizers in advance.
